# pi_approx
A collection of code implementations of various algorithms for approximating Pi, from https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-gregorys-series/

- Pi Approximators.ipynb contains the walkthrough in a presentable format.
- Pi Approximators.py is the content of the notebook exported directly into .py
- pi_to_txt.pi will run Nick Craig-Wood's optimised implementation of Chudnovsky and write two files: 1M digits of pi and 100M digits of pi
- pi_1m.txt holds 1M digits of pi, written by pi_to_txt.py
